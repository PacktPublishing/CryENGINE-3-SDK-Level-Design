This README is for the CryENGINE 3 SDK level design course

To download the CryENGINE 3 SDK and register to use the software please visit http://www.CryDev.net

Levels can only be shared on a per user basis due to limitations placed upon the free SDK by Crytek.  Due to this I cannot feasibly share the level with everyone as shown in the course.

The following files will be included with the course so the user can follow along with the videos:

Fire_Coals.mtl
High Poly Torus.cgf
Material and movement change.xml
Material Change.xml
Player Location.xml
Protective_field_alpha.tif
Proximity Material Change.xml
RTS camera control.xml
Simple animation.max
Test FG1.xml

TestTerrain_Heightmap.bmp
TestTerrain_Heightmap_lowrez.bmp
